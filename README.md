# Dataset Generation for Virtual Analog Modelling with Neural Network Models

This repository contains the code and resources for Claudia Guallarte's final degree project (TFG). The project focuses on generating datasets for virtual analog modelling of reverberation effects, a key aspect of audio signal processing and digital sound design.

Dataset used is extracted from Yu-Hua Chen's <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h9DrB4dk4QstgjNaHh7lL7IMeKdYw82_?usp=share_link">Google Drive Link</a> .

## Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a robust dataset that facilitates virtual analog modelling of reverberation effects. 

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** – Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **pip** – Python's package installer is required to install dependencies.

### Setup Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

#### Create the Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
#### Activate the Virtual Environment
##### Linux/Mac
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
##### Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, you can start working with the project.
