## Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a robust dataset that facilitates virtual analog modelling of reverberation effects. 

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** – Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **pip** – Python's package installer is required to install dependencies.

### Setup Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

#### Create the Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
#### Activate the Virtual Environment
##### Linux/Mac
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
##### Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, you can start working with the project.
